<h2>Three New Beavers from Utah</h2>

<h4>By</h4>

<h3>STEPHEN D. DURRANT AND HAROLD S. CRANE</h3>


<p>The subspecific identity of beavers from Utah seems never to have been
carefully investigated. With the exception of the name <i>Castor
canadensis repentinus</i> applied to animals from Zion and Parunuweap
canyons by Presnall (1938:14), all other writers from 1897 until the
present time, have used for animals from Utah, the name combination
<i>Castor canadensis frondator</i> Mearns, the type of which is from Sonora,
Mexico. Study of specimens of beavers from Utah, accumulated in the
collections of the Museum of Zo&ouml;logy, University of Utah, proves these
animals to be far more variable than formerly supposed, and discloses
the existence of three hitherto unnamed kinds, which are named and
described below.</p>

<p>We recognize the need for caution in proposing new names for American
beavers, because the transplanting of these animals from one watershed
to another may have permitted the animals of a given area to change
genetically, say, through hybridization, and may also have altered the
geographic distribution of the several kinds. The officials of the Utah
State Fish and Game Commission have assured us that such transplants
have not occurred in the areas where these three new kinds are found,
and further that nowhere in the state have transplants been made from
one major drainage system to another; such transplants as have been made
were only within the same major drainage system.</p>

<p>The capitalized color terms used in this paper are after Ridgway, Color
Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912. All
measurements are in millimeters. We are indebted to the officials of the
United States National Museum for the loan of comparative materials.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Castor canadensis pallidus</b> new subspecies</p>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Female, adult, skin and skull, number 719, Museum of Zo&ouml;logy,
University of Utah; Lynn Canyon, 7,500 ft., Boxelder County, Utah;
September 7, 1932; collected by W. W. Newby.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known only from the Raft River Mountains.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size small; tail and hind foot short (see measurements).
Color (type): Pale, upper parts uniformly Ochraceous-Buff; underfur
Snuff Brown; underparts uniformly Light Buff, grading to Light
Ochraceous-Buff at base of tail; underfur Light Drab; front and hind
feet Light Ochraceous-Buff. Skull: Rostrum short; nasals broad (breadth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>averaging 54 per cent of length), constricted posteriorly and barely
projecting posteriorly beyond premaxillae; zygomatic arches robust, but
not widely spreading (zygomatic breadth 77 per cent of basilar length);
mastoid breadth 73 per cent of zygomatic breadth; anterolateral margin
of orbit narrow (6.2); occipital condyles visible from dorsal view;
condylobasal length greater than occipitonasal length; upper incisors
narrow (Orange Chrome in color); coronoid processes high and wide; cheek
teeth narrow.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;Measurements of the type are as follows: Total length,
1040; length of tail, 380; length of hind foot, 157; length of ear, 35;
occipitonasal length, 129.1; basilar length, 116.6; mastoid breadth,
65.6; interorbital breadth, 23.6; length of nasals, 43.3; zygomatic
breadth, 89.7; breadth of nasals, 23.4; alveolar length of upper
molariform teeth, 30.4.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From topotypes and near topotypes of <i>Castor canadensis
taylori</i>, <i>C. c. pallidus</i> differs as follows: Size smaller; tail and
hind foot shorter. Color: Markedly lighter throughout. Skull: Nasals
shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of length of
nasals, as opposed to 46 per cent); nasals barely projecting posteriorly
beyond premaxillae; rostrum shorter; zygomatic breadth relative to
basilar length less; mastoid breadth actually as well as relatively
greater; interorbital breadth greater; occipitonasal length shorter
rather than longer than condylobasal length; tympanic bullae smaller;
coronoid process higher and wider; cheek teeth narrower.</p>

<p>From specimens of <i>Castor canadensis baileyi</i>, from 20 miles north
northeast of Elko, Elko County, Nevada, <i>C. c. pallidus</i> differs as
follows: Body smaller; tail longer; hind foot shorter; ears shorter:
Color: Markedly lighter throughout. Skull: Larger; nasals shorter and
wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of length of nasals as
opposed to 41 per cent); nasals barely projecting posteriorly beyond
premaxillae; rostrum broader; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar
length less; mastoid breadth actually as well as relatively greater;
occipitonasal length less rather than greater than condylobasal length;
tympanic bullae smaller; coronoid process higher and wider; cheek teeth
narrower.</p>

<p>From one topotype and two specimens of <i>Castor canadensis repentinus</i>,
from the Colorado River at Yuma, Yuma County, Arizona, <i>C. c. pallidus</i>
differs as follows: Tail and hind foot shorter. Color: Lighter
throughout. Skull: Narrower; nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals
averages 54 per cent of length of nasals as opposed to 47 per cent);
nasals barely projecting posteriorly beyond premaxillae; rostrum
shorter; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length less; mastoid
breadth actually as well relatively greater; tympanic bullae narrower
and smaller; coronoid process higher and wider; cheek teeth narrower.</p>

<p>From one specimen of <i>Castor canadensis concisor</i>, from Trappers Lake,
Garfield County, Colorado, and from the original description of that
subspecies (Warren and Hall, 1939: 358), <i>C. c. pallidus</i> differs as
follows: Size smaller. Color: Markedly lighter throughout. Skull:
Smaller, narrower; nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages
54 per cent of length of nasals as opposed to 48 per cent); rostrum
shorter; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length less; mastoid
breadth relative to zygomatic breadth greater; tympanic bullae narrower
and smaller; jugals narrower; distal end of meatal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span> tube smaller;
coronoid process shorter and wider; angular process shorter and rounded
rather than nearly pointed; cheek teeth narrower.</p>

<p>From the type and near topotypes of <i>Castor canadensis rostralis</i>, <i>C.
c. pallidus</i> differs as follows: Size smaller; tail and hind foot
shorter. Color: Markedly lighter throughout. Skull: Smaller and
narrower; rostrum shallower and narrower; posterior end of nasals more
constricted and barely projecting posteriorly beyond premaxillae;
zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length less; mastoid breadth
actually as well as relatively greater; dorsal surface of lacrimal bone
larger; tympanic bullae narrower; coronoid process higher and wider;
angular process not projecting so far caudad; cheek teeth narrower.</p>

<p>From the type and near topotypes of <i>Castor canadensis duchesnei</i>, <i>C.
c. pallidus</i> differs as follows: Size smaller; tail and hind foot
shorter. Color: Lighter throughout. Skull: Shorter, narrower and less
massive; nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per
cent of length of nasals as opposed to 46 per cent); nasals barely
projecting posteriorly beyond premaxillae; rostrum shorter and narrower;
zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length less; mastoid breadth
actually as well as relatively greater; tympanic bullae narrower and
smaller; coronoid process higher and wider; angular process not
projecting so far caudad; cheek teeth narrower.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The Raft River Mountains of extreme northwestern Utah, where
<i>C. c. pallidus</i> occurs, are the only mountains of the state within the
drainage of the Snake River. The Snake River proper lies 50 miles to the
northward in Idaho and contains another kind of beaver, <i>C. c. taylori</i>
(Davis, 1939: 273). Although occurring within the same drainage as <i>C.
c. taylori</i>, <i>C. c. pallidus</i> is as distinct from it as from any other
named kind. The relationships of <i>C. c. pallidus</i>, as indicated by the
short rostrum and short, wide nasals, are rather more with <i>C. c.
rostralis</i> of the Wasatch Mountains, than with <i>C. c. taylori</i>.</p>

<p>The pale color of the animals belonging to <i>C. c. pallidus</i> was noted at
the time of capture, and is the same in the young specimen (625 mm.
total length) as in the type, an adult.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Total, 2, distributed as follows:
<i>Boxelder County</i>: Raft River, 5 mi. S Yost, Raft River
Mountains, 6,000 ft., 1; Lynn Canyon, Raft River Mountains,
7,500 ft., 1.</p></div>


<p class="center"><b>Castor canadensis rostralis</b> new subspecies</p>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, young adult, skin and skull, number 5199, Museum of
Zo&ouml;logy, University of Utah; Red Butte Canyon, Fort Douglas, 5,000 ft.,
Salt Lake County, Utah; October 13, 1947; collected by Harold S. Crane
and Clifton M. Greenhalgh, original number 446 of Crane.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known from the western streams of the Wasatch Mountains;
probably occurs in all streams draining westward into the basin of
Pleistocene Lake Bonneville.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size large; tail and hind foot long (see measurements).
Color (type): Upper parts Snuff Brown, purest on head; underfur Brownish
Black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span> (2); base of tail Cinnamon Buff; hind feet Carob Brown; ears
Blackish Brown (2); underparts Auburn, grading posteriorly to Cinnamon
Buff; underfur Light Drab. Skull: Large, massive; nasals short and broad
(breadth averaging 54 per cent of length) and moderately convex
transversely; rostrum deep and broad; ventral surface of rostrum
moderately concave dorsally; dorsal surface of lacrimal bone small;
frontal region generally flat; zygomatic arches robust and widely
spreading (zygomatic breadth averaging 82 per cent of basilar length).</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;Measurements of the type and average and extreme
cranial measurements of 6 unsexed adults from Charleston, are,
respectively, as follows: Total length, 1,330; length of tail, 470;
length of hind foot, 170; length of ear, 34; occipitonasal length,
128.2, 134.3 (142.1-129.5); basilar length, 112.4, 117.2 (128.2-113.2);
mastoid breadth, 62.5, 64.3 (68.9-60.2); interorbital breadth, 27.9,
26.0 (26.9-26.0); zygomatic breadth, 91.3, 93.8 (105.8-90.8); length of
nasals, 44.9, 43.9 (51.3-41.5); breadth of nasals, 24.5, 23.7
(25.7-22.0); alveolar length of upper molariform teeth, 28.3, 30.9
(32.5-28.7).</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From topotypes and near topotypes of <i>Castor canadensis
taylori</i>, <i>C. c. rostralis</i> differs as follows: Color: Darker on upper
parts owing to darker underfur, guard hairs actually lighter. Skull:
Longer; nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent
of length of nasals as opposed to 47 per cent); extension of nasals
posterior to premaxillae less; rostrum shorter, broader and deeper;
dorsal surface of lacrimal bone smaller; zygomatic breadth relative to
basilar length greater; mastoid breadth relative to zygomatic breadth
less; coronoid process shorter; coronoid and condyloid processes farther
apart and space between them shallower.</p>

<p>From one topotype and two specimens from the Colorado River at Yuma,
Yuma County, Arizona, of <i>Castor canadensis repentinus</i>, <i>C. c.
rostralis</i> differs as follows: Size larger; tail longer. Color: Darker
throughout. Skull: Longer; nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals
relative to length of nasals averages 54 per cent as opposed to 47 per
cent); extension of nasals posterior to premaxillae less; rostrum
shorter, deeper and wider; zygomatic breadth relative to basilar length
greater; mastoid breadth actually as well as relatively greater; dorsal
surface of lacrimal bone smaller; coronoid and condylar processes
farther apart and space between them shallower.</p>

<p>From specimens of <i>Castor canadensis baileyi</i>, from 20 miles north
northeast of Elko, Elko County, Nevada, <i>C. c. rostralis</i> differs as
follows: Size larger; tail and hind foot longer. Color: Darker
throughout. Skull: Larger in all measurements taken; nasals markedly
wider (breadth of nasals relative to length of nasals averages 54 per
cent as opposed to 41 per cent); extension of nasals posterior to
premaxillae less; dorsal surface of lacrimal bone smaller; mastoid
breadth relative to zygomatic breadth less.</p>

<p>From one specimen of <i>Castor canadensis concisor</i>, from Trappers Lake,
Garfield County, Colorado, and from the original description of that
subspecies (Warren and Hall, 1939: 358), <i>C. c. rostralis</i> differs as
follows: Color: Guard hairs lighter; underfur darker (blackish as
opposed to brownish). Skull: Longer and narrower; nasals broader and
shorter (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of length of nasals as
opposed to 48 per cent); dorsal surface of lacrimal bone smaller; distal
end of meatal tube smaller; distal end of angular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span> process rounded
rather than pointed; coronoid process shorter; coronoid and condylar
processes farther apart and space between them shallower.</p>

<p>Among known kinds of <i>Castor canadensis</i>, <i>C. c. rostralis</i> is most like
<i>Castor canadensis duchesnei</i>, from which the former subspecies differs
as follows: Tail and hind foot longer. Color: Darker throughout. Skull:
Nasals shorter and wider (breadth of nasals averages 54 per cent of
length of nasals as opposed to 46 per cent); nasals less arched
transversely; rostrum shorter, deeper and broader; ventral surface of
rostrum less concave dorsally; dorsal surface of lacrimal bone smaller.</p>

<p>For comparison with <i>Castor canadensis pallidus</i>, see account of that
subspecies.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Animals from Kamas, in the drainage of the Weber River, are
intergrades between <i>C. c. rostralis</i> and <i>C. c. duchesnei</i>, but their
short, wide nasals and wide rostra make them referable to <i>C. c.
rostralis</i>.</p>

<p>The available specimens of <i>C. c. rostralis</i> are all from streams which
ultimately empty into Great Salt Lake, which is in the northern part of
the basin of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville. Some streams drain into the
Lake Bonneville Basin without emptying into Great Salt Lake proper.
Beavers from these streams, we suspect, when they become known, will be
found to be related to <i>C. c. rostralis</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Total, 16 (2 skins and skulls, 14
skulls only), distributed as follows: Summit County: Kamas,
5,500 ft., 6. <i>Salt Lake County</i>: Red Butte Canyon, Fort
Douglas, 5,000 ft., 1; Millcreek Canyon, 6 mi. above mouth,
7,000 ft., 1. <i>Wasatch County</i>: Charleston, Heber Valley,
5,500 ft., 8.</p></div>


<p class="center"><b>Castor canadensis duchesnei</b> new subspecies</p>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, young adult, skin and skull, number 4625, Museum of
Zo&ouml;logy, University of Utah; Duchesne River, 10 miles northwest of
Duchesne, 5,600 ft., Duchesne County, Utah; September 23, 1946;
collected by Dave Thomas, original number 160 of K. R. Kelson.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Drainage of the Duchesne and White rivers in Utah and
Colorado.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size large; tail long (see measurements). Color (type):

base of tail; underfur Fuscous; hind feet Burnt Umber; ears Fuscous
Black; underparts Tawny Olive; underfur Smoke Gray. Skull: Large,
massive; nasals long, slender (breadth averaging 46 per cent of length)
and markedly convex transversely; rostrum long and attenuate; zygomatic
arches heavy and widely spreading (zygomatic breadth averaging 81.5 per
cent of basilar length); ventral surface of rostrum markedly concave
dorsally, especially immediately behind upper incisors; nasals extend
posterior to premaxillae.</p>

<p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;Measurements of the type and average and extreme
cranial measurements of 9 unsexed adults, from Currant Creek, are,
respectively, as follows: Total length, 1,176; length of tail, 458;
length of hind foot, 165; length of ear, 33; occipitonasal length,
123.6, 132.1 (138.5-122.3); basilar length, 98.6, 114.4 (125.8-99.2);

<p>From specimens of <i>Castor canadensis baileyi</i>, from 20 miles north
northeast of Elko, Elko County, Nevada, <i>C. c. duchesnei</i> differs as
follows: Size larger; tail and hind foot longer. Color: Guard hairs
lighter, underfur darker. Skull:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span> Larger in all measurements taken;
nasals broader and longer (breadth of nasals averages 46 per cent of
length of nasals as opposed to 41 per cent); rostrum broader and longer;
mastoid breadth relative to zygomatic breadth less; tympanic bullae
larger.</p>

<p>From one specimen of <i>Castor canadensis concisor</i>, from Trappers Lake,
Garfield County, Colorado, and from the original description of that
subspecies (Warren and Hall, 1939: 358), <i>C. c. duchesnei</i> differs as
follows: Color: Lighter throughout. Skull: Nasals more convex
transversely; rostrum narrower; ventral border of rostrum more concave
dorsally, especially immediately behind upper incisors; distal end of
meatal tube smaller; angular process shorter and rounded rather than
pointed; cheek teeth smaller.</p>

<p>Among known subspecies of <i>Castor canadensis</i>, <i>C. c. duchesnei</i> is most
like <i>Castor canadensis repentinus</i>, but differs from the latter as
follows: Size larger; hind foot shorter. Color: Darker throughout.
Skull: Basilar length less; mastoid breadth greater; nasals shorter and
narrower; extension of nasals posterior to premaxillae less; nasals more
convex transversely; cheek teeth smaller.</p>

<p>For comparisons with <i>Castor canadensis pallidus</i> and <i>Castor canadensis
rostralis</i>, see accounts of those subspecies.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The extent of the range of <i>C. c. duchesnei</i> within the
drainage of the White River is not definitely known. Three animals from
9-1/2 miles southwest of Pagoda Peak, Rio Blanco County, Colorado, from
the drainage of the White River, are intergrades between <i>C. c.
concisor</i> and <i>C. c. duchesnei</i>. They are like the latter subspecies in
shape and length of the nasals, less expanded distal end of the meatal
tube and the rounded angular process, and it appears best, pending the
acquisition of more material, to refer them to C. c. duchesnei. Another
specimen, number 2090, Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas,
from Trappers Lake, Garfield County, Colorado, at the headwaters of the
White River, and only 16 miles distant from the three aforementioned
animals, is, however, nearly typical of <i>C. c. concisor</i>. Relying upon
the original description (Warren and Hall, 1939: 358), this animal is
like <i>C. c. concisor</i> in size and shape of the jugals, in size of the
distal end of the meatal tube and in the pointed end of the angular
process. Warren and Hall (<i>loc. cit.</i>) noted that animals assignable to
<i>C. c. concisor</i> occurred throughout the mountainous parts of Colorado,
and recorded them from the headwaters of nearly all the major rivers of
that state. Apparently <i>C. c. concisor</i> also occurs in the headwaters of
the White River, while the main part of the river is inhabited by
animals referable to <i>C. c. duchesnei</i>.</p>
